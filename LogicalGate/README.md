# Logical Gate Project

This project implements various logical gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, If Then, If AND Only If) using character inputs 't' and 'f' to represent true and false. The program allows users to input values for P and Q, select a logical operation, and displays the result.

## Files

- **src/LogicalGate.c**: Contains the implementation of the logical gates and the main function for user interaction.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `src` directory.
3. Compile the `LogicalGate.c` file using a C compiler.
4. Run the compiled program.
5. Follow the prompts to enter values for P and Q, and select the desired logical operation.

## Logical Operations

- **AND**: Returns true if both P and Q are true.
- **OR**: Returns true if at least one of P or Q is true.
- **NOT**: Returns the negation of P and Q.
- **XOR**: Returns true if P and Q are different.
- **If Then**: Returns false if P is true and Q is false.
- **If AND Only If**: Returns true if both P and Q are either true or false.
